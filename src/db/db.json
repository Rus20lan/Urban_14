  "biography": "Producer, DJ and songwriter ATB – otherwise known in the real world as Andre Tanneberger – can look back on 20 extremely successful years in the international music business. The arrival of his new double album neXt allows us to share his equally promising vision of the future. Andre Tanneberger’s sharp rise to excellence began in the mid 1990s when his debut single 9 PM (Till I Come) shot to the very top of the UK charts and scored top 10 successes in many other countries around the globe. His creative spirit continued to flourish with an impressive string of hits like Ecstasy, Let U Go, What About Us, Move On and When It Ends It Starts Again. Gold and platinum awards in numerous territories underlined his status, mirrored by his constant presence in the prestigious DJ Mag Top 100 rankings for a decade and a half. ATB is one of just a handful of musicians to have emerged from the German club scene to become worldwide superstars – from Australia to Asia, Mexico to Poland, Russia and, above all, in the USA.",

  "quotes": [
    "“My taste in music is really broad. When I record an album, I want it reflect my interest in the full spectrum of electronic club music – from energetic, pumping tracks to chilled out, ambient pieces. And you can’t squeeze all of that onto one CD.”",
    "“Nearly all of my tracks can be played on guitar or piano – I see myself as a songwriter and I aim to convey emotions through melodies. Who knows, maybe one day I’ll release an unplugged album…?”",
    "“What really matters, is that I have a clear vision of the album in my head. And that takes time. I reach a point which you might call zero. Once I have arrived there, I can begin. The vocalists are fully integrated into the process, most of them are songwriters themselves so they often come up with melodies which can flow into my songs as essential elements of the tracks. This is one of the main reasons why I can stay true to my own sound whilst still having the capacity to surprise people with new twists in the music.”"

      "id": 1,
      "question": "How did you manage to create such a distinctive sound?",
      "answer": "When I’m sitting in the studio with my keyboard or my guitar, ideas simply come into my head and I record them there and then. I combine the melodies with typical ATB sounds. I create the music I love. And at the end of the day, it somehow sounds like me."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "When you look back, would you change something?",
      "answer": "I’m really happy with how things have developed, I have seen trance music build and build, I was right there when EDM took over, so many exciting times really! Yet here I am, still making ATB music and still loving going out on the road to play for the ATB family all over the world! So I wouldn’t change a thing."

      "question": "You’ve just launched a new album (neXt). Could you tell us the story behind it?",
      "answer": "It is my tenth studio album, hence the X in the name, the Roman numeral for ten. It took a little longer to make than some of my previous albums, but I hope the wait has been worth it! It features a great range of collaborations again, which is important to me."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Where is that energy coming from?",
      "answer": "The fans give me so much energy, I’m very grateful for that. There’s so much interaction between the crowd and me on stage. But it’s also the fact that I like to spend time in the studio to make music… and to write a whole album takes a lot of time!"
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Is there someone in the business that you want to collab with but you haven’t yet?",
      "answer": "There’s no particular artist who comes immediately to mind. I’m always listening out for unusual or distinctive voices."

    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Do you have a favorite album (out of your 10 albums)?",
      "answer": "I’m the kind of guy who prefers to look forward rather than into the past. Every album means something special to me when it is released and that’s never changed. I’m already thinking about my next album and I have started to have a few ideas for that one."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "What was your first studio like?",
      "answer": "I had my first studio in my childhood room in my parents' apartment. Back then I didn't have much space and if I wanted to work with someone else in the same room, you had to sit behind each other. From my savings I bought a Commodore Amiga 500, the DAW Notator and I had 2 synthesizers, speakers and a mixer. That's how I started in the early 90s."

      "question": "Do you personally see a potential for deeper forms of Artificial Intelligence in your music?",
      "answer": "I do believe that AI will accelerate and optimize some processes in the future. But I have developed my own sound over the years and many things happen intuitively and don't follow any rules. I said 20 years ago that I would still like to make music in 20 years. And I say the same thing today ... I prefer to do the job myself."

      "question": "What qualities should a DJ have to be successful?",
      "answer": "To become a successful DJ, you don't need to think about success as such. You need to think about music, love it. Music should be in your blood and you should believe in what you are doing! Many years ago, I became a musician precisely because I loved electronic music. Of course, good production work is important for the success and popularity of every DJ. But the most important thing is to believe and do what you like."

    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What have you been doing all this time?",
      "answer": "If, for example, you compare it with most rock bands and the time they need to record a new album, then two years is not enough. Although, the question is fair. I got married, moved to a new house, traveled all over the world once again… My private life was so full that there was almost no time for music."
